Expert System with Forward & Backward Chaining
This project is a Python-based expert system that supports both forward and backward chaining inference techniques. Rules and facts are parsed from structured input into Python data structures. The system determines whether a goal can be inferred using logic-based reasoning.

📌 Features
✅ Forward Chaining: Infers all possible facts from initial ones.

🔄 Backward Chaining: Tries to prove a given goal by reasoning backward from it.

📄 Rule Parsing: Rules are parsed into conditions and conclusions arrays.

📚 Facts Parsing: Initial facts are stored in a dictionary.

🔁 Loop detection in backward chaining to avoid infinite recursion.

🧠 Prints Facts added each step with goal numbers
